# chingu-solo-project


Platform for manage coding challenges.
My dream is to create a platform for manage coding challenges that are real world problems, not puzzle or algorithm.

Example of problems:
- develop API services to manage account creation
- create batch for import data in not-relational DB
- create angular app based on the provided mockup


The paltform will contains the following functionalities:
- login through Google
- role choices: platform administrator or coder


In the future can be extended the functionalities:
- role choices: client that manages the contest
- TODO

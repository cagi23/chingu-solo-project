Platform for manage coding challenges.
My dream is to create a platform for manage coding challenges that are real world problems, not puzzle or algorithm, with popular technologies like angular, node.js, java, spring... etc

Example of problems:
- develop API services to manage account creation
- create batch for import data in not-relational DB
- create angular app based on the provided mockup


The paltform will contains the following functionalities:
- login through Google
- role choices: platform administrator or coder
- the administrator can create contest
- the coder can register to a contest and see the leaderboard



In the future can be extended the functionalities:
- role choices: client that manages the contest
- TODO

The first step is to create the unique feature of this platform:
The developer level system.

Define levels based on a point system where developers earn XP (experience points) based on their activities and contest.

1️⃣ Example Developer Levels<br>
Level Title XP Range<br>
🟢 1 Junior Developer 0 - 999<br>
🔵 2 Intermediate Dev 1,000 - 4,999<br>
🟣 3 Senior Developer 5,000 - 14,999<br>
🟠 4 Expert Developer 15,000 - 29,999<br>
🔴 5 Elite Developer 30,000+<br>
2️⃣ How to Earn XP?<br>
XP can be gained from multiple activities:<br>

Coding Contributions

+50 XP for a merged PR
+10 XP for a commit in an active repo
+100 XP for solving a high-difficulty bug
Code Reviews

+20 XP for reviewing a PR
+50 XP if the review is approved by other senior developers

XP earned by coding challenge platform
+50 contest api
+150 batch
+50 batch

+30 XP for answering a question on Stack Overflow +40 XP for publishing a technical blog post +100 XP for giving a conference talk Challenges & Certifications

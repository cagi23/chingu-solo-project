Platform for manage coding challenges.
My dream is to create a platform for manage coding challenges that are real world problems, not puzzle or algorithm, with popular technologies like angular, node.js, java, spring... etc

Example of problems:
- develop API services to manage account creation
- create batch for import data in not-relational DB
- create angular app based on the provided mockup


The paltform will contains the following functionalities:
- login through Google
- role choices: platform administrator or coder
- the administrator can create contest
- the coder can register to a contest and see the leaderboard



In the future can be extended the functionalities:
- role choices: client that manages the contest
- TODO
